### My experience developing

 - This mobile application for Android has been developed using Flutter, a technology that allows you to create applications quickly and efficiently. The development experience was very smooth and easy, allowing me to create a CRUD with SQLite efficiently. Even though it's a relatively simple app, I'm proud of the end result and think it shows Flutter's potential as a platform for developing high-quality, modern mobile apps.
